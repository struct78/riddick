# Riddick

A Python script that "borrows" case study videos and other media from the Cannes website.

## Requirements
This script requires Python 2.7+. All dependencies are included in requirements.txt. To install, simply run:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Running
```python riddick.py```

The script will run until all media items are downloaded. If it fails, you can restart it and it will ignore media it has already downloaded.
